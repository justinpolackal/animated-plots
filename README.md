# animated-plots
## One of many ways to animate a matplotlib chart. 

Here I chose to create individual plots and save them as PNG and later stitch them together to form an animated GIF.

The data is sourced from Gapminder and was re-formatted to create the chart the way I wanted it.

The python [notebook](https://github.com/justinpolackal/animated-plots/blob/master/BirthAndMortalityRate_OverYears.ipynb) has the code to create PNG files and animated GIF.
